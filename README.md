# ðŸ“ž AVOXI Telecom Billing Performance Dashboard - Project Overview

### Goal: Identify high-volume countries and top-performing vendors to guide future expansion strategies and optimize market penetration.

AVOXI, a global leader in cloud communications, provides virtual phone numbers and enterprise voice solutions in 150+ countries.
This billing analysis for Januaryâ€“March 2024 evaluates telecom performance to uncover revenue trends, vendor efficiency, and customer profitability drivers.
The insights highlight high-potential markets, vendor performance gaps, and usage behavior patternsâ€”offering a solid foundation for strategic pricing, vendor negotiations, and targeted growth initiatives.

## **Insights Summary**

### **Call Activity & Usage Patterns**

* **February** dominates activity with **69.35% of total calls**, followed by January (25.44%) and March (5.25%).
* **Average call duration** is \~4.15 minutes, with **73% of calls above average duration** (52,985 calls).

### **Vendor Performance**

* **Vendor 4** leads with **23.1K calls**, followed by Vendor 1 (20.2K) and Vendor 3 (13.1K).
* Gross margin % varies significantly: Vendor 3 has the highest at **43%**, while Vendors 1 and 4 are at **35%**.
* Vendor 2 handles **74 numbers** but only 9.1K calls, indicating underutilization.

### **Country Insights**

* **France** leads with **29.8K calls**, followed by Australia (13.1K) and the UK (11.7K).
* The **United Kingdom** has the highest number of accounts (101), but France generates more call traffic.
* South Africa and Chile have minimal volumes (under 3K calls).

### **Device Usage**

* Mobile dominates with **45.1K calls** vs. 26.9K on landline.
* Landline calls may offer higher stability but represent a smaller share of traffic.

### **Financial Performance**

* Gross margin % peaked in **February (41%)**, slightly higher than January (39%), but dropped sharply in March (31%).
* Vendor billing is consistently \~60â€“65% of client billing, indicating strong but variable cost control.

## **Recommendations**

* **Focus on High-Volume Countries** â€“ Strengthen presence in France, Australia, and the UK where call volumes are highest.
* **Vendor Optimization** â€“ Renegotiate with lower-margin vendors and reallocate traffic to high-performing ones like Vendor 3.
* **Improve Vendor Utilization** â€“ Boost traffic for underused vendors like Vendor 2 to leverage existing capacity.
* **Target Mobile Users** â€“ Launch mobile-specific plans or incentives, as mobile dominates usage share.
* **Monitor Seasonal Trends** â€“ Plan for February spikes and address Marchâ€™s margin drop with cost controls.
* **Prioritize Long-Duration Calls** â€“ Since 73% of calls are above average duration, consider differentiated pricing for extended calls.
